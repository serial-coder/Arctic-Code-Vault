*Dear all men and aliens from the future,\
\
My name is Phuwanai Thummavet.\
You can also call me Bright.\
I was here, Earth.\
You can contact me if you are interested (and yeah if I'm still alive).\
I prefer Thai over other languages if you speak it too.\
\
By the way, I also attached my picture below if you would like to see it.\
\
Warm regards,\
Phuwanai Thummavet\
